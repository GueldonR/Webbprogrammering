1. Steg 3: Form validation — `validation.js` is empty
   - Need: Multiple HTML events (keypress, mousedown, mouseup, focus, input, change, load)
   - Need: Validation for email, phone, names, address

2. Steg 7: React booking history — Not found
   - Need: React + Babel implementation
   - Need: Booking history rendered with React
   - Need: HTML table layout (not just divs)
   - Need: Fetch API integration

### What you have

- Steg 1: SPA navigation — Done
- Steg 2: History API — Done
- Steg 6: LocalStorage — Done
- Steg 5: API integration — Partially done (user login/registration)

### What needs verification

- Steg 4: CSS animations — Need to check `main.css`
- Steg 5: Search functionality — Need to check if flight search works
- Steg 5: Booking functionality — Need to check if booking screen exists
- Steg 1: Booking history screen — Need to check if it exists

## Action items before submission

1. Implement form validation (Steg 3)
2. Implement React booking history (Steg 7)
3. Verify all screens exist (booking, search results, booking history)
4. Verify CSS animations are implemented
5. Test all functionality end-to-end

Should I implement the missing parts (validation and React booking history) now?
